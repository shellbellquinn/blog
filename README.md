# Custom CMS

In this activity we will create a CMS (Content Management System) that allows users to upload blog posts. Users will also be able to view blog posts by other authors and filter them based on category. We will use the Context API to manage the application state globally, adhering to a design pattern that closely follows Redux. Although very complex applications may have several stores, we are going to keep it simple and store all stateful data in a single global store.
